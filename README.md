# AI-with-opencv
This repository will have ally my code using AI vistion capabilities using opencv
# seting up environment for opencv
## Run the following command
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
## install the following libraies  
    pip3 install opencv-python
    pip install opencv-python
## For object regonition you would need a model<br>
The COCO dataset contains over 330,000 images with more than 2.5 million object instances labeled across 80 categories.<br>
The dataset can be downloaded from the official COCO website (http://cocodataset.org/#download).<br>

# Car detection from avi video
    python3 ./car_detector.py
![Alt text](Car_detection.png?raw=true "car")<br>

# Face detection form image
    python3 ./face_detection.py
You should now have a file face_detected.png<br>
open face_detected.png to see the face that was detected<br>
